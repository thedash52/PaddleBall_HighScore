### Basic Details ###

Summary: This is a project that I created to display my abilities using Unreal Engine 4.  
Version: Beta_1.0

### Details ###
So far this is a mostly complete game that can run nearly endlessly.  
This game is for mobile.  
Currently I have been unable to build and cook the project into os specific installers so this repo is code only.

Some of the things that I still want to do are:

	* Add a save feature to record the level you are on, your current score and the high score
	* Fix the brick rebound and removal
	* Upgrade the paddle rebound as at the moment all it has is a basic reverse y direction rebound
